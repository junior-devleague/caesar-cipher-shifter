# caesar-cipher-shifter
[Intermediate] Python Caesar Cipher program 


## Objective
You have been sent undercover on secret mission to the remote town of Tamarindo, Costa Rica. Your new day job will be working for the local newspaper "El Guardi√°n". However, you will need to be able to communicate to headquarters back in North America. You and your team have already decided you are going to use a Caesar Cipher to encode and decode your messages. Use your knowledge of Python (functions, while loops, if/else statements, variables, data types, etc.) to create your Casesar Cipher Program.

## Prerequisites
- Students should have completed doctors-visit, cheer-up, etc.. (Fill in more info here for other repos that should be done)
- Students should know how to use variables, global variables, data types, functions, user input, while loops, if/else statements, return, basic math, etc.

## Your Challenge

Part 1:
 1. Write out the logic of what we need the program to do and define the followinf functions (getMode, getMessage, getEncrypt, runCipher) 
 2. The first coding we need to do is define our alphabet as a variable key by setting symbol = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
 3. You may need to come back and define some variables here as we go.
 5. Inside your function create a while loop to ask if the user would like to encrypt or decrypt

Part 2:
1. Create a function called getMessage to ask the user for their message 
2. How can we do some error checking to make sure the user enters a valid message?

Part 3:
 1. Create a function called getEncrypt
 2. You will need to define your 3 global variables first
 3. Ask the user for the key (or the shift) they want to use
 4. In an if statement, define the key. It should be a number from 1-26 right?

 5. Then we need to define the character in the message to apply the shift
  
 6. Then do a print statement to return the encrypted message


Part 3:
 1. Create a function called getDecrypt, just like getencrypt
 2. Define your 3 global variables
 3. Ask the user for the key they want to use

 4. Do the same  as in Part 3 step 5 (hint: For char in message:) 


Part 4: 
 1. Create a function called runcipher
 2.  Call your functions so that they all run


Lab Challenge- Part 5:
 1. Ask the user if they want to keep playing or quit the game
 2. Go back through your program and add error checking to each of your functions. What does that mean? It means you need to anticipate that the user may not enter valid input. So how do you either prevent that from happening or prompt them to enter what you want?
