[Intermediate] Python Caesar Cipher program 


## Objective
You have been sent undercover on secret mission to the remote town of Tamarindo, Costa Rica. Your new day job will be working for the local newspaper "El Guardi√°n". However, you will need to be able to communicate to headquarters back in North America. You and your team have already decided you are going to use a Caesar Cipher to encode and decode your messages. Use your knowledge of Python (functions, while loops, if/else statements, variables, data types, etc.) to create your Casesar Cipher Program.

## Your Challenge

Part 1
1. Write out the logic of what we need the program to do
2. The first coding we need to do is define our alphabet as a variable key by setting symbol = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
3. We will need to come back and define some variables here as we go.
4. Create your first function to start asking user for the message they want to encrypt
5. Inside your function create a while loop to ask if the user would like to encrypt or decrypt
